# Autonomous_car
we introduce the implementation of a price-guide robot using machine vision
and sensors to ease the process of price guides. The robot will replace the current 
screens. The robot will follow black lines wherever they go, and provide information
about the item once the clients have given it the command to do so. The robot detects 
moving bodies, thus providing information about items, using bar code.
